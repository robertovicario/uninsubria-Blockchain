Understanding Permissioned BFT-Based Consensus and the Tendermint Protocol



The document discusses the concepts of permissioned consensus in blockchain technology, particularly focusing on a protocol called Tendermint. This summary will break down the important points to make these concepts easier to understand, even for someone new to the topic.



What is Permissioned Consensus?

Permissioned Consensus: Unlike public blockchains where anyone can join, a permissioned blockchain restricts who can participate in the network. It provides greater control and is often used in business environments.

The Tendermint Protocol

Tendermint is a widely used consensus protocol that helps various blockchains agree on the state of their data. It provides two key guarantees:

Consistency: All participating nodes (computers in the network) agree on the same transactions. Imagine having all team members on the same page at a meeting—everyone should understand and agree on what decisions are being made.

Eventual Liveness: Every transaction that is submitted to the network will eventually be added to the blockchain for all nodes to see, much like how a delayed email eventually arrives.

Communication Models



The Tendermint protocol operates under the Partially Synchronous Model, which is more realistic than purely synchronous (everything happens at the same time) or asynchronous (messages can be delayed indefinitely) models:



Partially Synchronous Model:



Normal Operations: Messages get delivered within a reasonable time.

Attack Mode: Messages can be delayed for unpredictable lengths of time.

The system is designed to perform reasonably well in both scenarios.



Synchronous Model:



Everything happens in a fixed timeframe, making it easier to reason about, but it's not very practical in real-world situations.



Asynchronous Model:



Messages can be delayed without any time frame, but this makes achieving consensus very challenging.

Why the Partially Synchronous Model?



The partially synchronous model strikes a balance between the purely synchronous and asynchronous models. It acknowledges that while communication can be delayed, there are limits. This model allows for good consensus strategies to be developed without the drawbacks of the other two models.



Safety and Liveness in Consensus Protocols



In any consensus protocol, two main properties need focus:



Safety: Ensuring all nodes have consistent views of the blockchain. Think of it as multiple people keeping the same score in a game - they should all have the same score at any time.



Liveness: Making sure that new transactions are eventually processed. It’s like ensuring that in a race, all runners reach the finish line eventually.



To achieve this, the Tendermint protocol requires that at least 67% of nodes must be honest and follow the rules for the system to work correctly.



Fault Tolerance



In a network, you may encounter different types of faulty nodes:



Crash Fault: A node that suddenly stops functioning (like a computer crashing).

Omission Fault: A node fails to send a message (like forgetting to submit homework).

Byzantine Fault: Nodes that actively act against the protocol by sending conflicting or misleading information (like a player cheating in a game).



To ensure that the consensus protocol works despite potential failures or malicious behavior, it's crucial to understand how many faulty nodes can exist while still achieving consensus.



Conclusion



The Tendermint protocol stands as an essential component of many blockchain systems that aim to provide stable, reliable consensus. By effectively managing communication delays and ensuring consistency and liveness, it helps maintain the integrity of transactions in permissioned blockchains. Understanding these concepts equips learners with the foundational knowledge necessary to explore more complex areas of blockchain technology and distributed systems.
