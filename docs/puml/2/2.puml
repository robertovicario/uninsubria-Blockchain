title Byzantine Broadcast (BB) Protocol

entity Source
control "Node 1" as Node1
control "Node 2" as Node2

==Initialization==
note over Source, Node2
The source node sends a message to all nodes
end note
Source -> Node1 : Send message
Source -> Node2 : Send message

==Propagation==
note over Source, Node2
Each node forwards the message it receives to all other nodes
end note
Node1 -> Node2 : Forward message
Node2 --> Node1 : Forward message

==Acknowledgment==
note over Source, Node2
Each node applies a decision rule based on the messages received
end note
Node1 -> Node1 : Apply decision rule
Node2 -> Node2 : Apply decision rule

==Termination==
note over Source, Node2
The protocol terminates when all honest nodes agree on the same value
end note
Node1 -> Node2 : Agreed
Node2 --> Node1 : Agreed
